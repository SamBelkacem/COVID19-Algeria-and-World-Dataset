# COVID19-Algeria-and-World-Dataset
A coronavirus dataset with 90 countries constructed from different reliable sources, where each row represents a country, and the columns represent geographic, climate, healthcare, economic, and demographic factors that may contribute to accelerate/slow the spread of the COVID-19. The assumptions for the different factors are as follows:

- **Geography:** some continents/areas may be more affected by the disease
- **Climate:** cold temperatures may promote the spread of the virus
- **Healthcare:** lack of hospital beds/doctors may lead to more human losses
- **Economy:** weak economies (GDP) have fewer means to fight the disease
- **Demography:** older populations may be at higher risk of the disease
